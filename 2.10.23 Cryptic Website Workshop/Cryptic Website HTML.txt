 The amount of brain cells each officer has is a <span style="color:blue">number</span> that is evenly divided by <strong>too tens and a seven</strong> by a rooted <strong>tree</strong> times then the <span style="color:blue">number</span> is multiplied by itself.<br>
  
<br>Oh no! That <span style="color:blue">number</span> is too many! <em>Before dividing by the tens place</em>, the <span style="color:blue">number</span> must collect <strong>tree tens and won</strong>.<br>
    
<br>Itâ€™s not right yet.
Take away 3! And you have the <span style="color:blue">number</span>!

  <!-- This div contains the lock, counter, and buttons on the page. Any properties we give to
       this div is applied to everything. If an element has attributes within its opening tag, 
       those attributes take priority over the div's attributes. 
  
          From top to bottom we are: making an image, creating our counter display, then creating
          a div to hold both of our buttons. This is important when looking at the CSS.
