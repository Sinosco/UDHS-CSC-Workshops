Hello, I am Shaikh Ahmed, an officer or co-leader or whatever my position is because I was never formally told what my role is. This role was honestly just thrusted 
on me one day but hey whatever here we are now. This folder contains all the workshops I (Shaikh) created during the 2022-2023 school year. They were all made by me
and contain notes on how they work (except Orpheus Run, we don't talk about Orpheus run). I hope you future generations can find benefit from these and continue on 
with coding if you so desire. 

All these workshops were originally created and ran on replit.com, if you are no longer using that website then I hope you are smart enough to figure out how to convert
code into something more standardized. I am but a sentimental old man (17 y/o as of writing this), it's weird talking to future people who I don't even know. Hopefully
the world isn't close to ending by the time someone actually takes the time to read this.

Honestly I just meant to write how we used replit for these workshops but hey you get to somewhat enjoy the ramblings of a man that you didn't even know existed. 
Ig I should give credit to the other co-leaders, officers, whatever they are. 

Rafia Mobashira, Gurneet Kaur, Keyla Peralta Alberto, and me, Shaikh Ahmed. 

idk how to end this note okay bye :thumbsup:
