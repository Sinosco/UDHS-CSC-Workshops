  <!--To better see the code close the web viewer on the right so it is just this text editor.
        We start by creating a <table> tag, and within it we put <tr> (table row) tags for rows of our table.
        Within these rows we create columns with <th> (table header) tags. Notice how in this example we have 4 <tr> tags with 
        2 <th> tags in each. We are creating a 4x2 table, 4 rows with 2 columns. 

        Our layout is an image with a link attached and a little description to go with it. Every image has an id "logoImages"
        and every text has an "textDesc" id. We set most of the link target to "_blank" so they open in another tab, most websites
        won't allow you to open links inside your webpage and have to be opened in another tab. All text boxes are aligned left just
        to make it look nicer.
